            <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
                <p class="article-intro">Beyond the glossy brochures, what are the facilities actually like? I've tested the changing rooms, the food options, the seating areas, and the pool itself. Some things exceeded expectations, others fell short. This is a practical guide to what you'll actually use and what might not be worth the hype.</p>

                <h2>Changing Rooms and Lockers</h2>
                <p>Let's start with the basics. The changing rooms are located on the ground floor, accessible from the main entrance. There are separate facilities for men and women, and both follow the same layout: individual cubicles, shared shower area, vanity section with mirrors, and lockers.</p>
                <p>The cubicles are private and spacious enough to change comfortably. Each has a bench and hooks for your clothes. The doors lock securely, which I appreciated. What I didn't love: the ventilation isn't great, so it can get humid, especially when it's busy.</p>
                <p>The showers are clean and functional. They have both hot and cold water, and the pressure is decent. The soap dispensers are always filled, which is a small detail but shows good maintenance. However, the shower area floor can get slippery, and the drainage isn't perfect—water tends to pool in certain spots.</p>
                <p>Lockers are standard size, about 30cm wide and 40cm tall. They're enough for a day bag, towel, and change of clothes. The key system is simple: you get a key attached to your wristband when you check in. The lockers are located in the changing room, so you can access them throughout the day.</p>
                <p>One practical note: the lockers don't have charging ports, so if you need to charge your phone, you'll need to use the charging stations near the pool area or keep your device with you.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Pool Areas: Main Pool, Infinity Section, and Relaxation Pool</h2>
                <p>The main pool is the centerpiece, and it's impressive. It's about 25 meters long and 10 meters wide, with varying depths. The shallow end is around 1.2 meters, perfect for families, and it gradually deepens to about 1.8 meters at the far end. The water is consistently clean and well-maintained—I've never seen it cloudy or with debris.</p>
                <p>The pool deck is made of non-slip tiles, which is essential given the heat. However, they do get very hot in direct sunlight, so water shoes or flip-flops are recommended when walking around. The loungers are arranged around the pool, and they're comfortable enough for extended use. They're the standard resort-style loungers with adjustable backs.</p>
                <p>The infinity edge section is smaller, maybe 8 meters by 5 meters, but it offers the best views. The water there is slightly cooler, which I prefer after being in the main pool. This section tends to be the most photographed, so it can get crowded, especially in the afternoon when the light is best for photos.</p>
                <p>The relaxation pool is warmer, almost like a large hot tub. It's shallower, around 1 meter deep, and it's designed for lounging rather than swimming. This is where people go to unwind, and it's usually less crowded than the main pool. The temperature is perfect for evening visits when the air starts to cool down.</p>

                <h2>Seating and Shade Options</h2>
                <p>This is where things get interesting. The facility has three types of seating: standard loungers, cabanas, and daybeds. The standard loungers are free with admission and are first-come, first-served. They're comfortable, but shade is limited. The umbrellas are fixed in position, so you can't adjust them, and they don't cover the entire lounger.</p>
                <p>The cabanas are available for rent and offer more privacy and guaranteed shade. They come with a small table, a mini-fridge (stocked with water), and better seating. The rental cost is around 300-500 AED depending on the day and location. Is it worth it? If you're planning to spend the whole day and want guaranteed shade and privacy, yes. If you're just there for a few hours, probably not.</p>
                <p>The daybeds are the premium option, positioned in the best spots with the best views. They're larger, more comfortable, and come with additional amenities. The rental is higher, around 600-800 AED. These are popular for groups or special occasions.</p>
                <p>My recommendation: arrive early (before 10 AM) if you want a good free lounger in the shade. Otherwise, consider renting a cabana if shade is important to you. The sun is intense, and spending hours in direct sunlight isn't comfortable or safe.</p>

                </div>

                <h2>Food and Beverage Options</h2>
                <p>The facility has two main food options: the restaurant and the poolside bar. The restaurant is indoor, air-conditioned, and offers table service. The menu is international with Middle Eastern influences. I've tried several dishes over multiple visits, and the quality is consistently good, though not exceptional.</p>
                <p>Popular items include the grilled chicken, the mezze platter, and the burgers. The portions are reasonable, and the presentation is nice. The service is professional, though it can be slow during peak hours (12-2 PM and 5-7 PM). Prices are what you'd expect: mains are 80-120 AED, appetizers 40-60 AED, and desserts 35-50 AED.</p>
                <p>The poolside bar offers lighter fare: salads, sandwiches, and snacks. The service is faster here, and you can order from your lounger. The bar also serves drinks, including cocktails, mocktails, and non-alcoholic options. The cocktails are well-made, and the mocktails are refreshing, especially the mint lemonade.</p>
                <p>One thing to know: you can't bring outside food or drinks. They check bags at the entrance, and while water bottles are allowed, anything else gets confiscated. This is strictly enforced, so don't try to sneak anything in.</p>
                <p>The wristband system means you can't pay with cash at the poolside. Everything is charged to your account, and you settle up when you leave. This is convenient, but it also makes it easy to overspend since you're not handling physical money.</p>

                <h2>Additional Amenities</h2>
                <p>The facility has a few additional amenities worth mentioning. There's a small gym area, though it's basic—just a few machines and free weights. It's not a full gym, but it's useful if you want to do a quick workout before or after swimming.</p>
                <p>There are charging stations scattered around the pool area, which is helpful since the lockers don't have charging ports. The Wi-Fi is free and generally reliable, though it can be slow during peak times when many people are using it.</p>
                <p>The facility provides towels, which is included in admission. They're decent quality, not the thin, scratchy ones you sometimes get. You can exchange them for fresh ones throughout the day if needed.</p>
                <p>There's also a small shop near the entrance that sells sunscreen, swimwear, and other essentials. The prices are marked up, as you'd expect, but it's convenient if you forget something.</p>

                <h2>What Works and What Doesn't</h2>
                <p><strong>What works well:</strong> The pool water quality is excellent, the changing rooms are clean and functional, the food is decent, and the overall maintenance is good. The staff are professional and helpful.</p>
                <p><strong>What could be better:</strong> The shade situation is limited for free loungers, the changing room ventilation needs improvement, the food prices are high relative to quality, and the Wi-Fi can be unreliable during peak times.</p>
                <p><strong>What surprised me:</strong> How quickly the good spots fill up, even on weekdays. The difference between the cabanas and free loungers is significant, especially in terms of shade and privacy. The wristband payment system is convenient but makes overspending easy.</p>

                <h2>Practical Recommendations</h2>
                <ul class="article-list">
                    <li>If shade is important, either arrive very early or rent a cabana.</li>
                    <li>Bring your own sunscreen—the shop prices are high.</li>
                    <li>Water shoes or flip-flops are essential for the hot deck and wet changing room floors.</li>
                    <li>Budget more than you think for food and drinks—the wristband system makes it easy to overspend.</li>
                    <li>The restaurant is better for a proper meal; the poolside bar is fine for snacks and drinks.</li>
                    <li>Charge your devices before arriving, or use the charging stations near the pool.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="article-outro">The facilities are solid overall—not five-star luxury, but well-maintained and functional. The key is knowing what to expect and planning accordingly.
